= Google Analytics Reports, Stats and Insights =

Analytics Insights displays the reports you need on your dashboard and on the site's frontend. Audience, acquisition, behavior, engagement and real-time stats are all presented as charts within a dedicated dashboard widget.  

In addition to a set of general Google Analytics stats, insights like in-depth Page reports and in-depth Post reports are available.

The Google Analytics tracking code is fully customizable through options and hooks, allowing advanced data collection like custom dimensions and events.

Google Analytics reports, in real-time, in your dashboard screen:

- Real-time number of visitors 
- Real-time number of visitors per page

No, once the plugin is authorized and a default domain is selected the Google Analytics tracking code is automatically inserted in all webpages.

= Why the numbers on Google Analytics 4 don't match those from Universal Analytics =

To put it simply, different technologies and approaches lead to different results.
