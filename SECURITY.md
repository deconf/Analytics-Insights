Every day we do our best to make sure [Analytics Insights (AIWP)](https://deconf.com/analytics-insights/) is safe and secure. But we’re only human, and there’s always a chance that we missed something. That’s where you come in – find a security weakness in our plugin, report it on [deconf.com](https://deconf.com/contact/), and get listed as a contributor!
